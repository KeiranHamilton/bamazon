# Bamazoncustomer.js

## About The App

In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront using several of the MYSQL skills
I learned in week 12. Bamazon will show an inventory of items with their quantity and prices. 
The application is able to take in orders from customers while giving them their total cost 
and, it will also deplete stock from the store's inventory as purchases are made. If there isnt
enough inventory for what the user would like to purchase it will let the user know and cancel the order.
